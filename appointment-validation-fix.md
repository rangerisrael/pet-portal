# Appointment Validation Logic - FIXED ✅

## Issue Fixed

Previously, pets with any existing appointments (including completed ones) couldn't book new appointments. Now the system properly validates based on appointment status.

## What Changed:

### 1. Smart Validation Logic
**File**: `src/hooks/useAppointments.js`
- **Fixed**: Only blocks new appointments if pet has ACTIVE appointments
- **Active statuses**: `scheduled`, `confirmed`, `in_progress`
- **Allowed statuses**: `completed`, `cancelled`

```javascript
// New validation logic
const activeStatuses = ['scheduled', 'confirmed', 'in_progress'];
const existingActiveAppointments = appointments.filter(
  appointment =>
    appointment.pet_id === appointmentData.pet_id &&
    activeStatuses.includes(appointment.status?.toLowerCase())
);
```

### 2. Enhanced User Interface
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/forms/AppoinmentForm.js`

**Added Features**:
- **Pet availability checker**: Shows which pets are available vs. have active appointments
- **Visual indicators**: Blue info box showing all pets and their status
- **Disabled options**: Pets with active appointments are disabled in dropdown
- **Clear labeling**: Shows "Has Active Appointment" for unavailable pets

### 3. Better User Experience
- **Availability overview**: Users can see at a glance which pets are available
- **Clear feedback**: Specific error messages mentioning pet names
- **Visual distinction**: Available pets vs. pets with active appointments

## How It Works Now:

### ✅ ALLOWED - Pet can book new appointment when:
- **No existing appointments** (new pet)
- **Previous appointments are completed**
- **Previous appointments are cancelled**
- **Editing existing appointment** (bypass validation)

### ❌ BLOCKED - Pet cannot book new appointment when:
- **Has scheduled appointment**
- **Has confirmed appointment**
- **Has in-progress appointment**

## Visual Interface:

### Pet Selection Form Shows:
1. **Availability Overview Box**:
   - Blue info section listing all pets
   - Green "Available" vs Orange "Has active appointment"

2. **Dropdown Options**:
   - Available pets: Normal selection
   - Unavailable pets: Grayed out with " - Has Active Appointment" suffix

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Specific pet name in error: "Buddy already has an active appointment..."

## URL Correction:

**⚠️ Important**: Use the correct URL!
- ❌ Wrong: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/pet-owner/appointment
- ✅ Correct: **http://localhost:3002**/dashboard/pet-owner/appointment

## Testing Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Pet with Completed Appointment
1. Pet "Buddy" has a completed appointment
2. Click "Book Appointment" for Buddy
3. ✅ **Should work**: Form allows new appointment booking

### Scenario 2: Pet with Active Appointment
1. Pet "Luna" has a scheduled appointment
2. Click "Book Appointment" for Luna
3. ❌ **Should block**: Shows error "Luna already has an active appointment..."

### Scenario 3: Multiple Pets
1. Mixed statuses: Some pets available, some with active appointments
2. Form shows availability overview
3. Dropdown disables unavailable pets
4. User can only select available pets

The appointment validation now works correctly, allowing new bookings for pets with completed appointments while properly blocking pets with active appointments!
