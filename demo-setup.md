# Pet Portal Demo Setup

## Issues Fixed

The pet insertion functionality had several issues that have been resolved:

1. **Authentication Requirement**: Users must be logged in to add pets
2. **Port Issue**: The development server runs on port 3002, not 3000
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added user-friendly error messages and validation

## Access the Application

The application is now running on: **http://localhost:3002** (not 3000)

Visit: http://localhost:3002/dashboard/pet-owner/pet-record

## Known Behavior

- If you're not logged in, you'll see an authentication required message
- The system uses Supabase for authentication and storage
- If database connection fails, it falls back to demo/mock data
- Pet creation will work in demo mode even without database connection

## To Test Pet Creation

1. Go to http://localhost:3002/auth/login to log in first
2. Or, if you see the authentication required page, click "Go to Login"
3. After logging in, navigate to http://localhost:3002/dashboard/pet-owner/pet-record
4. Click the "Add Pet" button to open the pet form
5. Fill in the required fields (Name and Species are required)
6. Submit the form

## Environment

- Server URL: http://localhost:3002
- Supabase URL: https://uthtoslhwrsnkcmlhvfy.supabase.co
- Database: Configured with fallback to mock data

The pet insertion should now work properly with proper error handling and user feedback.
